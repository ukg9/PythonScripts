Monitoring Area	Objective
False Positive Rate	Assess the rate of legitimate transactions incorrectly flagged as suspicious, to evaluate model precision and minimize customer friction.
True Positive Rate	Measure the proportion of actual fraud cases correctly identified by the model, indicating its effectiveness in detecting fraud.
Manual Review Volume	Monitor the number of transactions escalated for manual review, to gauge operational impact and potential model inefficiencies.
Trend Over Time	Track changes in key metrics over time to detect model drift, emerging fraud patterns, or rule degradation.
Operational Feedback	Incorporate feedback from fraud analysts on flagged transactions to understand rule performance and refine processes.
Case Outcomes (where available)	Use confirmed fraud labels or outcomes to validate model accuracy and support recalibration if needed.
