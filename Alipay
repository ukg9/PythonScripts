Metric Name | Formula / Definition | Business Significance
True Positive Rate (TPR) | TP / (TP + FN) — Proportion of actual frauds correctly identified by the model | Measures the model’s ability to detect fraud; higher values indicate better detection
False Positive Rate (FPR) | FP / (FP + TN) — Proportion of legitimate transactions incorrectly flagged as fraud | Indicates the rate of unnecessary alerts; lower values reduce customer friction and cost
Manual Review Volume | Count of transactions flagged for manual intervention | Reflects operational burden; helps assess whether model output is manageable
Alert Conversion Rate | Confirmed Fraud Alerts / Total Alerts | Measures precision of alerts; helps evaluate review efficiency and rule quality
Fraud Rate | Confirmed Fraud Transactions / Total Transactions | Gives an overall fraud trend; helps contextualize model performance
Review-to-Fraud Ratio | Transactions Sent for Review / Confirmed Fraud Cases | Indicates efficiency of manual review process; lower ratios are preferred
Trend Deviation | Change in key metric values over a defined time period | Flags possible model drift or changes in fraud patterns
Average Transaction Amount (Flagged) | Sum of flagged transaction amounts / Number of flagged transactions | Helps assess financial risk exposure from flagged transactions
