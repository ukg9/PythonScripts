The LexisNexis Fraud Intelligence Model V1 requires adherence to a structured, step-by-step process for operation. Below are the detailed procedures for running the model effectively:

Input Data Extraction and Preparation

Extract relevant input data from the system, ensuring all required attributes (e.g., identity and transaction data) are available in the specified format.
Perform data cleaning to address missing or erroneous values and apply any necessary transformations for compatibility with the model.
Checking the Correctness of Input Data

Validate the input data for completeness and correctness using predefined checks, such as ensuring no mandatory fields are missing or contain invalid values.
Model Settings and Parameter Validation

Ensure that all model settings, assumptions, and parameters are configured as per the standard operational guidelines.
Verify that the settings align with the production scoring code.
Initiating the Processing Component

Launch the processing phase of the model, using the validated input data and the scoring algorithm (XGBoost implementation).
Completion Verification

Confirm that the model execution has completed successfully without errors or interruptions. Log the execution status for auditing purposes.
Output Extraction

Extract the model outputs, including fraud risk scores and associated warning codes, in the specified format.
Validation of Model Outputs

Check the outputs to ensure they are within the expected range (e.g., fraud risk scores between 0 and 998).
Validate specific records, especially edge cases, to confirm that the model is scoring accurately.
Report Generation

Generate standard performance and operational reports, such as fraud detection rates (FDR), AUC metrics, and detailed attribute analyses.
Report Distribution

Distribute the reports to the designated stakeholders, ensuring that sensitive data is handled securely and in compliance with relevant regulations.
By following these steps, users can ensure the accurate and consistent operation of the model, enabling reliable fraud risk assessment and decision-making. Adjustments or troubleshooting should be escalated to LexisNexis technical support if anomalies are detected during any step.
