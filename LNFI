The LexisNexis Fraud Intelligence Model V1 is based on the Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) algorithm, specifically implemented using XGBoost. This methodology inherently captures complex, non-linear relationships between features and the target variable, without requiring explicit monotonic constraints.

Monotonicity Consideration:
In this model, monotonicity of relationships between features and the target variable is not explicitly enforced. The nature of XGBoost allows it to flexibly model both increasing and decreasing relationships as needed, optimizing for predictive accuracy rather than imposing monotonic constraints. This approach is suitable for fraud detection models, where interactions between variables and fraud risk may exhibit non-linear and non-monotonic patterns.

Configuration for Monotonicity:
While XGBoost provides functionality to impose monotonicity constraints on features if required, such constraints were not deemed necessary for this model. The decision not to enforce monotonicity aligns with the empirical findings during model development, where the relationships between input features and fraud risk varied in complexity and direction.

The absence of monotonic constraints ensures that the model leverages the full predictive power of the features, allowing it to adaptively fit the underlying patterns in the data. This flexibility enhances the model's performance for detecting fraudulent activity, as demonstrated by its high AUC and Fraud Detection Rate (FDR) during validation.
