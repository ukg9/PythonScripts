1. Data Sources
Internal Data: Data from LexisNexis systems containing historical fraud cases, transactional records, and application attributes.
External Data: Contributions from third-party data providers, such as identity verification data, credit history, and other public record sources.
2. Inputs
Primary Attributes: Features like identity data (e.g., SSN, DOB, name, and address) and transactional information.
Pre-Processed Data: Attributes already cleaned and standardized for input into the model.
3. Quality Assurance Control Points
Data Cleaning and Validation:
Missing values handled appropriately (e.g., imputation or flagging).
Validation against business rules to ensure data accuracy.
Check for Data Distribution: Confirm that attribute distributions match the expected patterns.
4. Intermediate Processes and Results
Feature Engineering:
Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) is used to optimize feature selection.
Model Execution:
The XGBoost algorithm processes input attributes to generate a fraud risk score.
Intermediate outputs such as decision tree splits, feature importance rankings, and cumulative error metrics are produced.
5. Outputs
Fraud Risk Scores:
Each transaction or application receives a score indicating its likelihood of being fraudulent (on a scale of 0 to 998).
Warning Codes:
Flags for specific high-risk conditions detected by the model.
6. Reports
Operational Reports: Fraud detection rate (FDR), area under the curve (AUC), and risk score distributions are summarized.
Compliance and Performance Reports: Include additional metrics to satisfy internal and external review standards.
7. Feedback Loop
Review Mechanism: Fraud case outcomes are evaluated for continuous improvement and potential inclusion in future model iterations.
