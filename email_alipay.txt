Clarification Required for Model Documentation Report (MDR) Responses about ALIPAY
Hi Charles,

Hope you're doing well.

PFB the attached file containing the requirements for the Model Documentation Report (MDR). Based on our recent discussion, it is now clear that the model in question operates entirely as a rule-based model.

Upon reviewing the vendorâ€™s previously shared responses included in the attached file, we noticed that some of them may be partially accurate. For instance, references to statistical techniques such as stratified sampling or cross-validation, etc., do not appear to align with the nature of a rule-based model. We kindly request the vendor to clarify whether these responses are legitimate and applicable to this specific model.

To ensure the accuracy of the MDR, we request the vendor to review and identify the responses relevant to this model and provide any necessary updates or corrections. Since these responses form the foundation of the documentation, it is crucial to align them with the model's actual functionality.

If there are any additional details or clarifications needed from our end to assist with this process, please let us know.

Looking forward to your response.

Kind Regards,
Uttam Kumar Gupta
